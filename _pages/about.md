Hello, I am on a researcher position at Inria, Brittany, France (WIDE team).

(Jean Baudrillard, Fatal Strategies.)

My main current research activity is trying to disprove that quote, by studying [black-box algorithms](https://github.com/erwanlemerrer/blackbox-algorithms) in the context of recommender systems, neural-network models, or decision-making algorithms in general. I co-organized the workshop ["Algorithmes en Boite-Noire"](http://atelier-blackbox.conf.citi-lab.fr/), in an attempt to link several research domains on this societal question. e.g.:
* [Monitoring 2022 elections on YouTube](https://elections.audits.eu.org).
* [Audited shadow banning pratices by Twitter](https://twitter.com/whosban_?lang=en).
