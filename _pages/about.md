Hello, I am on a researcher position at Inria, Brittany, France, ([WIDE team])(https://team.inria.fr/wide/team/). 

>"Maybe, not content to be alienated by observation, maybe does the
>object deceive us? Maybe it invented original answers, and not only
>the ones we ask for? May not be does it not want to be analyzed and
>observed at all and taking this for a challenge (which is true), does
>it respond with another challenge? [...] the object analyzed today
>triumphs everywhere, by its object position, over the subject of analysis."
(Jean Baudrillard, Fatal Strategies.)

My main current research activity is trying to disprove that quote, by studying [black-box algorithms](https://github.com/erwanlemerrer/blackbox-algorithms) in the context of recommender systems, neural-network models, or decision-making algorithms in general. I co-organized the workshop ["Algorithmes en Boite-Noire"](http://atelier-blackbox.conf.citi-lab.fr/), in an attempt to link several research domains on this societal question. e.g.:
* [Monitoring 2022 elections on YouTube](https://elections.audits.eu.org).
* [Audited shadow banning pratices by Twitter](https://twitter.com/whosban_?lang=en).

### Background

I was a senior research scientist at Technicolor R&I (2009-2018), where I worked on scalable storage, processing and machine learning for data analytics. I joined Inria in 2018, an on a permanent researcher position in 2021. I obtained my habilitation (HDR) on November 2016 from University of Rennes 1. I am the president and on of the sysadmins of the gozdata association, that provides the gozmail service, built from free software. I am a board member of the [Société Informatique de France](https://www.societe-informatique-de-france.fr/).
